Forrest Wieland (creator of webpages)

This is a mock webpage for my friend Chris Simons, a plumber (who does not own a plumbing buisness).

The Functionality of this webpage, includes navigation links to go between: homepage, services, and contact page.
Also to call or email the company directly. Contact Form is included.

This webpage contains pictures, image carousel(bootstrap), font-changes, headers, footers, contact information, hyperlinks,
and information regarding company 

Technologies used:
Html5, CSS3, Javascript; Bootstrap 4, font awesome, google fonts, Formspree io, git, github, github-pages,  



a few ideas for future improvement:
navigation links in image carousel, img selectors on image carousel
side bars with random information/ads 
different backgrounds for web pages
